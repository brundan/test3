```

# Assign 5 to the variable x
```

x <- 5
```

test_error()
test_object("x",
            undefined_msg = "Make sure to define `x`!",
            incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly assigned 5 to `x`!")
success_msg("Awesome! It's considered good style to write spaces either side of the assignment arrow.")
